# AI-ChatBot-Application
An AI Chatbot Application built using a Hugging Face Large Language Model (LLM) is a conversational system that leverages transformer-based deep learning models to understand and generate human-like responses in natural language.
The system enables users to interact with an AI assistant in real time through a browser-based UI. It supports contextual multi-turn conversations, natural language understanding, and dynamic response generation.
